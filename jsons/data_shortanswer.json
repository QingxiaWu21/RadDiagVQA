        "Question": "A 45-year-old female patient (para 2 live 2) was referred to the Department of Gynaecology with non-specific complaints of pain in the abdomen on and off for 1 year, which was relieved by taking medication. Menstrual history was insignificant. An ultrasonography (USG) report of the whole abdomen, which was done outside at a primary diagnostic centre, revealed a multi-loculated complex cystic lesion measuring 5.8 x 5.0 cm in the right adnexa, showing thin and thick internal septations, a few of which showed mild vascularity on colour Doppler, raising suspicion of a neoplastic aetiology of right ovarian origin. The right ovary was not seen separately or distinctly from the above mentioned lesion. However, USG suggested normal size and position of the left ovary. No obvious left adnexal mass was noted. The rest of the ultrasound findings revealed no other significant abnormalities. Therefore, in view of USG findings, the patient was referred to the Radiology department for further evaluation by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the pelvis. CA-125 serum marker was also advised to rule out malignant pathology. What is the diagnosis?",
